# Plymouth Whitemarsh Polling Site

this is just my Adv Web Dev project. The site will be created with React, Node, Mongo and Express
commonly known as a MERN stack.

These technologies have been chosen by me because I haven't used/been taught any of them in my high school CS courses.

Is it overkill to use all of this for a voting site for a high school? Yes

Am I going to do it anyway? Yes

Do I care that it's overkill? No
